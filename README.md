# Configuring-SSO-on-JupyterHub-using-providers-like-Okta
Single sign on in a simple word can be explained as Primarily Your identity is authenticated and authorized right at the entrance of architecture then you go about the job which you intended to do. Or in detail we can say that SSO Technology combines several different application login screens into one. With it, a user only has to enter their login credentials (username, password, etc.) one time on a single page to access all of their SaaS applications. It solves key problems for the business by providing: Greater security and compliance.
Jupyter Hub is a multi-user server that provides a web-based interface for Jupyter notebooks. It can be used to allow users to access and run notebooks on a central server, rather than on their own machines. Single Sign-On (SSO) is a way to allow users to log in to multiple applications using a single set of credentials.
To configure SSO on Jupyter Hub using providers like AWS or Okta, you will need to follow these steps:

1.Set up a Jupyter Hub instance. You can either install Jupyter Hub on your own server or use a cloud-based service such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2.Set up an identity provider. An identity provider is a service that manages user identities and authentication. AWS and Okta are both examples of identity providers. You will need to create an account with the identity provider and set up a way for Jupyter Hub to communicate with the provider (e.g., by creating an application in Okta).

3.Configure Jupyter Hub to use the identity provider. You will need to install and configure an authenticator plugin for Jupyter Hub that supports the identity provider you are using. For example, if you are using Okta, you can use the jupyterhub-okta-authenticator plugin.

4.Set up user accounts. Users will need to create accounts with the identity provider in order to log in to Jupyter Hub. You may also need to configure Jupyter Hub to create user accounts automatically when a new user logs in for the first time.

5.Test the SSO configuration. Once you have set up the SSO configuration, you should test it to ensure that users can log in to JupyterHub using their credentials from the identity provider.

Here is an example of how to set up SSO with Okta on Jupyterhub
First, log in to your Okta account and go to the Applications page. Click the "Add Application" button and select the "Web" option.

 . On the next page, enter a name for the application (e.g., "JupyterHub") and click the "Next" button.

 . On the "Configure Web Settings" page, set the "Base URI" and "Login redirect URI" to the URL of your Jupyter Hub instance (e.g., https://jupyter.example.com). Then    click the "Done" button.

 .  On the "Assignments" page, assign the application to the users or groups that should have access to Jupyter Hub

 On your JupyterHub server, install the jupyterhub-okta-authenticator plugin using the following command:
           pip install jupyterhub-okta-authenticator

In the JupyterHub configuration file (jupyterhub_config.py), add the following lines to configure the Okta authenticator:
             c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'okta.OktaOAuthenticator'
c.OktaOAuthenticator.client_id = 'your-client-id'
